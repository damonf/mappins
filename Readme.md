Mappins
=========

A node.js app that uses the google maps API for viewing the placemarks stored in a KML file.  At the moment you can import a KML file and the placemarks are loaded into a mongo database before being displayed on the map as a bunch of pins.

This is a work in progress with edit and export features coming soon.

Note: You need to have node.js and mongodb installed and running and an active internet connection.

Tech
-----------

Mappins uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

* [node.js] - evented I/O for the backend
* [Express] - web application framework for node
* [Twitter Bootstrap] - great UI boilerplate for modern web apps
* [jQuery] - duh 
* [jade] - node template engine 
* [less] - the dynamic stylesheet language
* [mongodb] - a scalable, high-performance, open source NoSQL database 
* [q] - tool for making and composing asynchronous promises in JavaScript 
* [mocha] - a feature-rich JavaScript test framework 
* [underscore] - a utility-belt library for JavaScript
